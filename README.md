# Course-Data-Mining

Did this project with two fellow students Nadav and Harshita. It was about solving multiple data mining problem. Next to the code we wrote I have also added the reports we have written.
We received a 8.4 for the first exercise (counts for 40%) and a 9.33 for the second exercise (counts for 60%). Therefore our final grade was a 9.

# Course-Data-Mining

Did this project with two fellow students Nadav and Harshita. It was about solving multiple data mining/data sciences problems for the course Data mining
at the Vrije Universiteit. The first part had multiple data mining problems. The second part was about search engine optimization for a travel agency called 
Expedia. Next to the code we wrote I have also added the reports we have written and the orginal assignments.
We received a 8.4 for the first exercise (counts for 40%) and a 9.33 for the second exercise (counts for 60%). Therefore our final grade was a 9.
